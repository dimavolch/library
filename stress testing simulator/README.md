  Generate 90% code coverage with integration tests in 1 hour
</p>
<br>
Pythagora is a tool that generates integration tests for your Node.js app by recording server activity without you having to write a single line of code.


<br>
<h1 id="alphaversion">üèÅ Alpha version</h1>
This is an alpha version of Pythagora. To get an update about the beta release or to give a <b>suggestion on tech (framework / database) you want Pythagora to support</b> you can üëâ <a href="http://eepurl.com/ikg_nT" target="_blank">add your email / comment here</a> üëà .
<br>
<br>


<h1 id="howitworks">üèóÔ∏è How it works</h1>

To integrate Pythagora into your Node.js app, you just need to install the pythagora package
```
npm install pythagora
```
and run the Pythagora capture command. Then, just play around with your app and from all API requests and database queries Pythagora will generate integration tests.

<h3>1. Capturing requests</h3>
Pythagora records all requests to endpoints of your app with the response and everything that's happening during the request. Currently, that means all Mongo and Redis queries with responses (in the future 3rd party API requests, disk IO operations, etc.). Then, when you run the tests, Pythagora can simulate the server conditions from the time when the request was captured.
<h3>2. Running tests</h3>
When running tests, it doesn‚Äôt matter what database is your Node.js connected to or what is the state of that database. Actually, that database is never touched or used ‚Äî> instead, Pythagora creates a special, ephemeral `pythagoraDb` database, which it uses to restore the data before each test is executed, which was present at the time when the test was recorded. Because of this, tests can be run on any machine or environment.
<br>
<br>
<b>If a test does an update to the database, Pythagora also checks the database to see if it was updated correctly.</b>

<h1 id="setup">‚öôÔ∏è Setup</h1>

1. Install Pythagora by running
   <br><br>
   ```
   npm install pythagora
   ```
   And that's it! You are ready to start recording your integration tests!
<br>
<h1 id="capturingtests">üé• Capturing tests</h1>

1. <b>From the root directory</b> run Pythagora in a capture mode first to capture test data and mocks.
   <br><br>
      ```
      npx pythagora --initScript ./path/to/your/server.js --mode capture
      ```
   Eg. if you start your Node.js app with `node ./server.js` then the command would be:
   <br><br>
      ```
      npx pythagora --initScript ./server.js --mode capture
      ```
2. Click around your application or make requests to your API. Pythagora will capture all requests and responses.
   <br><br>
NOTE: To stop the capture, you can exit the process like you usually do (Eg. `Ctrl + C`)   
<br>
<h1 id="executingtests">‚ñ∂Ô∏è Executing tests</h1>

After you captured all requests you want, you just need to change the mode parameter to `--mode test` in the Pythagora command.
<br>
   ```
   npx pythagora --initScript ./path/to/your/server.js --mode test
   ```   

<br><br>
<h1 id="codecoveragereport">üìù Code Coverage Report</h1>

Code coverage is a great metric while building automated tests as it shows us which lines of code are covered by the tests. Pythagora uses `nyc` to generate a report about code that was covered with Pythagora tests. By default, Pythagora will show you the basic code coverage report summary when you run tests.
<br>
<br>

If you want to generate a more detailed report, you can do so by running Pythagora with `--full-code-coverage-report` flag. Eg.
   ```
   npx pythagora --initScript ./path/to/your/server.js --mode test --full-code-coverage-report
   ```
You can find the code coverage report inside `pythagora_tests` folder in the root of your repository. You can open the HTML view of the report by opening `pythagora_tests/code_coverage_report/lcov-report/index.html`.

<br>

In case you don't want the code coverage to be shown at all while running tests, you can run the tests with `--no-code-coverage` parameter.

<br><br>
<h1 id="authentication"> Authentication</h1>
For authentication we support <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/jsonwebtoken" target="_blank">JWT</a>, sessions stored in
<a href="https://redis.io/" target="_blank">Redis</a> and sessions stored in <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/mongodb" target="_blank">MongoDB</a>.
First 2 cases cases (JWT and sessions stored in Redis) should work just fine without
any additional implementation but for session that are stored in MongoDB you need to add this one line of code:

```
if (global.Pythagora) global.Pythagora.authenticationMiddleware = true;
```
just before your authentication middleware. For example, if you are using <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/express-session" target="_blank">express-session</a>
you would have to add our line of code just above your middleware that is managing sessions in your DB, like this:

```
...

if (global.Pythagora) global.Pythagora.authenticationMiddleware = true;

app.use(session({
    secret: 'my-secret',
    resave: false,
    saveUninitialized: false,
    cookie: {
        maxAge: 60 * 60 * 1000
    },
    store: MongoStore.create({
        mongoUrl: mongourl,
        mongoOptions: {
            useNewUrlParser: true,
            useUnifiedTopology: true
        }
    })
}));

...
```
That's it! You are ready to go and all your API requests with authentication should PASS!

<br><br>
<h1 id="testdata">üó∫Ô∏èÔ∏è Where can I see the tests?</h1>
Each captured test is saved in <strong><i>pythagora_tests</i></strong> directory at the root of your repository.
Each JSON file in this repository represents one endpoint that was captured and each endpoint can have many captured tests.
If you open these files, you will see an array in which each object represents a single test. All data that's needed to run a test
is stored in this object. Here is an example of a test object.

```json
{
  "id": "b47cbee2-4a47-4b2c-80a0-feddae3081b3",
  "endpoint": "/api/boards/", // endpoint that was called
  "body": {}, // body payload that was sent with the request
  "query": {}, // query params that were sent with the request

    ...
  },
  "statusCode": 200, // status code that was returned

      ],

        {

        }
      ],
      "postQueryRes": [ // data that was present in the database after the query was executed
        {

          "name": "Steve",
           ...
        }
      ]
    }
  ],
  "createdAt": "2023-02-22T14:57:52.362Z" // date when the test was captured
}
